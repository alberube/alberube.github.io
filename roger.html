<p>This is Roger the "unknown breed" cat! He is 7 or 8 years old and has completely black fur which is incredibly soft!
He may not look that friendly, but he is super affectionate!</p>
<p><I>NOTE:</I> Originally his name was ABC when we adopted him, but that name was kind of dumb so we changed it.</p>
